The reports were published between 1 July 2018 and 30st June 2019 and described one or several avian influenza outbreaks.  We collected 337 reports from PADI-web and 115 from HealthMap. Two epidemiologists identified all the reported events in the news, and classified them as official (notified to the World Organization for Animal Health) or non-official.

In order to trace back the source of the event’s information, the epidemiologist manually traced the information pathway of all events mentioned in the PADI-web and HealthMap news. The pathway was deducted from the sources cited in the news. When a source was cited with a hyperlink, we followed the hyperlink to retrace the information pathway as far as possible to the primary source. For each cited source, we created a pair of emitter SE and receptor sources SR. We labelled each new source with its type (e.g. online news source, national veterinary authority, etc.). We also recorded their geographical focus (local, national or international) and their specialization in the animal health news coverage (general or specialized).

The new MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) collection 6 provides numerous improvements compared to collection 5. However, being remotely sensed data in the thermal range, LST shows gaps in cloud-covered areas. With a novel method (Metz M., Andreo V., Neteler M. (2017): A new fully gap-free time series of Land Surface Temperature from MODIS LST data.) we fully reconstructed the  daily global MODIS LST products MOD11C1 and MYD11C1 (spatial resolution: 3 arc-min, i.e. approximately 5.6 km at the equator). For this, we combined temporal and spatial interpolation, using emissivity and elevation as covariates for the spatial interpolation. Here we provide a time series of these reconstructed LST data aggregated as monthly average, minimum and maximum LST maps.

The MOD/MYD13A1 Version 6 product provide Vegetation Index (VI) values at a per pixel basis at 500 meter (m) spatial resolution. There are two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions.
