YES,Annotation of epidemiological information in animal disease-related news articles: guidelines and manually labelled corpus,"This dataset contains two files: (i) An annotated corpus (""epi_info_corpus‧xlsx"") containing 486 manually annotated sentences extracted from 32 animal disease-related news articles. These news articles were obtained from the database of an event-based biosurveillance system dedicated to animal health surveillance, PADI-web (https://padi-web.cirad.fr/en/). The first sheet (‘article_metadata’) provides metadata about the news articles : (1) id_article, the unique id of a news article, (2) title, the title of the news article, (3) source, the name of the news article website, (3) publication_date, the publication date of the news article (mm-dd-yyyy) and (4) URL, the web URL of the news article. The second sheet (‘annot_sentences’) contains the annotated sentences: each row corresponds to a sentence from a news article. Each sentence has two distinct labels, Event type and Information type. The set of columns is : (1) id_article, the id of the news article to which the sentence belongs, (2) id_sentence, the unique id of the sentence, indicating its position in the news content (integer ranging from 1 to n, n being the total number of sentences in the news article), (3) sentence_text, the sentence textual content, (4) event_type, the Event type label and (5) information_type, the Information type label. Event type labels indicate the relation between the sentence and the epidemiological context, i‧e. current event (CE), risk event (RE), old event (OE), general (G) and irrelevant (IR). Information type labels indicate the type of epidemiological information, i‧e descriptive epidemiology (DE), distribution (DI), preventive and control measures (PCM), economic and political consequences (EPC), transmission pathway (TP), concern and risk factors (CRF), general epidemiology (GE) and irrelevant (IR).

YES,,"This dataset contains a set of tables corresponding to the manual analysis of outbreak-related reports detected by two event-based surveillance tools, PADI-web and HealthMap, supporting the submitted article ""Dissemination of information in event-based surveillance, a case study of Avian Influenza"".

The reports were published between 1 July 2018 and 30st June 2019 and described one or several avian influenza outbreaks.  We collected 337 reports from PADI-web and 115 from HealthMap. Two epidemiologists identified all the reported events in the news, and classified them as official (notified to the World Organization for Animal Health) or non-official.

In order to trace back the source of the event’s information, the epidemiologist manually traced the information pathway of all events mentioned in the PADI-web and HealthMap news. The pathway was deducted from the sources cited in the news. When a source was cited with a hyperlink, we followed the hyperlink to retrace the information pathway as far as possible to the primary source. For each cited source, we created a pair of emitter SE and receptor sources SR. We labelled each new source with its type (e.g. online news source, national veterinary authority, etc.). We also recorded their geographical focus (local, national or international) and their specialization in the animal health news coverage (general or specialized).

The imagery summarises a key environmental indicator, incorporating seasonal dynamics, for the MOOD study area. MODIS is a sensor on board two NASA satellites, providing near-daily coverage of the entire Earth. The MOD11A2 product contains an 8-day average of MIR at 1-kilometre resolution. Reflectance values have been adjusted to remove the distortion caused by view angle and land surface texture. 

Abstract: the Index values were extracted from MOD13A2 files for the years 2001 through to 2019, and then processed by a temporal Fourier processing algorithm. A stepwise system of thresholds and interpolations screened erroneous values and bridged gaps in the time series. The smoothed series was sampled at 5-day intervals and transformed into a set of sine curves describing annual, bi-annual, and tri-annual fluctuations. For each of these curves, the Fourier algorithm generated images expressing the amplitude, phase, and variance. Other output recorded the mean, minimum, and maximum of the time series, and error measured during the Fourier transform.

NO,2001_2019_MODIS_LandSurfaceDayTemperature_FourierProcessed_1k_ER,"This is a set of images produced by temporal Fourier analysis of global MODIS data 07 - DLST: Day-time Land Surface Temperature derived from the MOD11A2 Product from USGS. The imagery summarises some key environmental indicators, incorporating seasonal dynamics, for the MOOD study area.
 MODIS is a sensor on board two NASA satellites, providing near-daily coverage of the entire Earth. The MOD11A2 product contains an 8-day average of land surface temperature at 1-kilometre resolution. Reflectance values have been adjusted to remove the distortion caused by view angle and land surface texture. 

Abstract: Temperatures were extracted from MOD11A2 files for the years 2001 through to 2019, and then processed by a temporal Fourier processing algorithm. A stepwise system of thresholds and interpolations screened erroneous values and bridged gaps in the time series. The smoothed series was sampled at 5-day intervals and transformed into a set of sine curves describing annual, bi-annual, and tri-annual fluctuations. For each of these curves, the Fourier algorithm generated images expressing the amplitude, phase, and variance. Other output recorded the mean, minimum, and maximum of the time series, and error measured during the Fourier transform.

NO,2001_2021_ MODIS _NDVI_FourierProcessed_1k_ER,"This is a set of images produced by temporal Fourier analysis of global MODIS data for Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the MOD13A2 Product from USGS. the period 2001 2021 and is an update of the previous 2011 - 2019 series The imagery summarises a key environmental indicators, incorporating seasonal dynamics, for the MOOD study area.
 MODIS is a sensor on board two NASA satellites, providing near-daily coverage of the entire Earth. The MOD13A2 product contains an 16-day average of NDVI at 1-kilometre resolution. Reflectance values have been adjusted to remove the distortion caused by view angle and land surface texture. 

Abstract: the Index values were extracted from MOD13A2 files for the years 2001 through to 2021, as an update of the 2001-2019 series, and then processed by a temporal Fourier processing algorithm. A stepwise system of thresholds and interpolations screened erroneous values and bridged gaps in the time series. The smoothed series was sampled at 5-day intervals and transformed into a set of sine curves describing annual, bi-annual, and tri-annual fluctuations. For each of these curves, the Fourier algorithm generated images expressing the amplitude, phase, and variance. Other output recorded the mean, minimum, and maximum of the time series, and error measured during the Fourier transform. For a detailed descripton of the Fourier algorithm and its output, please see the article by Scharlemann et al., 2008 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001408)

The imagery summarises a key environmental indicator, incorporating seasonal dynamics, for the MOOD study area. 

Abstract: Monthly precipitation values were extracted from ERA5 files for the years 2019 through to 2020, and then processed by a temporal Fourier processing algorithm. A stepwise system of thresholds and interpolations screened erroneous values and bridged gaps in the time series. The smoothed series was sampled at 5-day intervals and transformed into a set of sine curves describing annual, bi-annual, and tri-annual fluctuations. For each of these curves, the Fourier algorithm generated images expressing the amplitude, phase, and variance. Other output recorded the mean, minimum, and maximum of the time series, and error measured during the Fourier transform.

This dataset includes 2020,2021,2022, and 2023.

These result in Boolean masks where suitable areas according to temperature limits on I. ricinus are identified as 1 and unsuitable areas as 0.  This mask can then be applied to the existing seasonal Tick model to make a more timely prediction of tick activity based on recent temperatures.

Image acquisition

Two different products are downloaded VIIRS Land Surface Temperature/Emissivity 8-day L3 Global 1 km SIN grid (VNP21A2, version 6) and VIIRS Land Surface Temperature/Emissivity Daily L3 Global 1 km SIN grid (VNP21A1D, version 6).

The cumulative temperature mask is processed in two steps through two separate scripts:

a. Acquisition of 1km MODIS Land Surface Temperature imagery from NASA's data repository.
b. Importing of the imagery into a Suitable format from which regularly updated masks are calculated.

NO,2021_Veterinary_Hospital_FacilityDistributions,"Veterinary and Hospital distributions. Full descriptions in Maps of Healthcare and Veterinary Locations.pptx. 

Abstract: These maps of veterinearfy facilkities and hospital health care locations are derived from the open source Open Street Maps (OSM). These are large datasets that underlie most of the satnav utilities, and are continuously updated by members of the public. They are compiled by GEOFABRIK, and can be downloaded from https://www.geofabric.de. Health care data have been further enhanced by the Global Health Sites Mapping Project (https://healthsites.io). 
 
 The data consist of locations (“points of interest”) and building outlines, and so are made up of points and polygon which are stored separately in the OSM files. Each record has a series of descriptors (“tags”) such as ‘amenity’ which may include descriptions such as hospital or veterinary clinic. These tags are provided by the people who add the data to the maps and o are multilingual and very variable. Most records contain additional more generic tags that can be used to identify classes of locations like hospitals or pharmacies.
  
 ERGO has taken the IO and OSM datasets, combined the polygon and point data, converted the polygons to points and removed any duplicates (where building outlines also have point location records), to produce and global datasets for healthcare and regional datasets for healthcare and veterinary locations covering Europe and its neighbouring countries. These are provided as ESRI point shapefiles as follows:
  Healthcare Global: Ionodewaynodupallmay21.shp
  Healthcare Regional: MONODWAYALLnodupMAY21.shp
  Veterinary Regional: afeupolypointsnondupmergemay21.shp
 
 The regional maps are produced by tabulating the number of each healthcare amenity or veterinary locations within administrative zones, normalising by the administrative unit areas. The maps aare produced from the following shape files:
  Healthcare Regional: MOiohealthamenitycountadmin2may21.shp
  Veterinary Regional: MONODWATALLVETSNODUPMAY21.shp

Abstract: The distributions of the known TBE vector hosts were obtained from IUCN and the European Mammal Atlas and covnverted to presence or absence within standard 50 km Grid and then ranked from 1 to 4 according to their function as follows:
 
 Reservoir Host and virus amplifiers. Score 4 = Apodemus flavicolis (Yellow necked mouse), Myodes glareolus (Bank vole) 
 Major Vector amplifiers and virus dilution. Score 3 = Capreolus capreolus (Roe deer) , cervus elephus (Red deer), Dama dama (Fallow Deer)
 Minor Vector amplifiers and virus dilution. Score 2 = Alces alces (Moose) , Odocoelus virginia (White tailed deer)
 Possible Vector Amplifiers Score 1= Lepus europeus (European hare), Lepus timidus (Mountain Hare)
 Host Predators Score -1 Vulpes vulpes (Red Fox)
 An equal number of zero (hosts absent) points were assigned randommly outside the known host ranges.
 
 The summed scores were then modeled using Random Forest and Boosted Regresion Trees spatial modelling methods, implemented using the VECMAP modelling suite, using a standard set of covariates including Fourier Processed Remotely Sensed environmental variables, land use proportions, human poplation and elevation. . The outputs of the two methodds were then ensembled as a simple mean.","TBE hosts, weighted ,mean score, spatial model","ERGO

Abstract: Temperature time series with high spatial and temporal resolutions are important for several applications. The new MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) collection 6 provides numerous improvements compared to collection 5. However, being remotely sensed data in the thermal range, LST shows gaps in cloud-covered areas. With a novel method (Metz M., Andreo V., Neteler M. (2017): A new fully gap-free time series of Land Surface Temperature from MODIS LST data) we fully reconstructed the daily global MODIS LST products MOD11A1/MYD11A1 (spatial resolution: 1 km). For this, we combined temporal and spatial interpolation, using emissivity and elevation as covariates for the spatial interpolation.

The data are processed for a spatial extent of central Europe (Spatial extent in EPSG:4326 (W, S, E, N): 0, 40, 40, 60) for the years 2003-2019 in daily resolution.","land surface temperature, MOOD-H2020, MODIS",mundialis,"Metz Markus (metz@mundialis.de),

The corresponding MODIS/Aqua product (MYD09A1 v006) could not be used due to the fact that the Aqua satellite has a number of broken detectors resulting in unreliable data for band 6 (SWIR) measurements.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra MOD09A1 Version 6 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of Terra MODIS Bands 1 through 7 corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the seven 500 meter (m) reflectance bands are two quality layers and four observation bands. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite period. The criteria for the pixel choice include cloud and solar zenith. When several acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the minimum channel 3 (blue) value is used.","water index, satellite, MODIS, Europe, MOOD-H2020",mundialis,"Metz Markus (metz@mundialis.de),

The MOD/MYD13A1 Version 6 product provide Vegetation Index (VI) values at a per pixel basis at 500 meter (m) spatial resolution. There are two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm for this product chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value.","NDVI, EVI, vegetation index, MOOD-H2020, Europe",mundialis,"Metz Markus (metz@mundialis.de),

NO,2024_Weeklyspecies_ridhness_abundance_selectedWNV_birdhosts_ Ebirddata,"Raw weekly abundance data at 3km resoultion was downloaded from EBIRD (https://science.ebird.org/en/use-ebird-data) for 12 listed WNV bird hosts.  These data were converetd to presence absence, and these then combined toi give a species number for each week.   The abundnace data were also proceeed to provided summed and meaned abundnace for each week.  
Files as follows
e4ebirdweeklyabundancemarini:	all weekly abundance datasets at 3km resolution.  						
e4ebirdweeklyPAMarini:	abundance with missing recoded to 0.  This is based of ad hoc checks of weekly datasets against the birdlife  species ranges,  which suggest that the maximum extents of combined weekly abundance distributions match the rage boundares fairly well 						
e4ebirdweeklyspprichnesMariniSUMMEANweeklymarini:	summed and mean weekly presence absence for all species.  If a species is missing a weekly dataset it is removed from the Mean value calculations for that week.  To maintain a constant maximum presenxe number in the summed number of present species,  missing weeks are filled with last valid presence week  up to halfway through the gap in availability, then with the first avaiklable distribution after the gap						
Species list: Carrion Crow; Wood Pigeon, European Collared Dove; European Blackbird; European Jackdaw; Europoean Jay; European Kestrel; European Magpie; Herring Gull, Hooded Crow; House Sparrow; Little Owl;
